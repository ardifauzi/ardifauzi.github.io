Hi, thank you for visiting my homepage. I am Ardiansyah Fauzi, a Ph.D. student in Civil Engineering at Nagoya University, Japan. I am currently started studying machine learning and really interested on utilizing it for tsunami early warning system. It is expected this approach able to forecast tsunami waveform and inundation in real-time manner.

In my free time, I enjoy culinary hunting, reading history/archaeology books, and riding bicycle.
