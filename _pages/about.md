Hi, thank you for visiting my homepage. I am Ardiansyah Fauzi, a lecturer in
Civil Engineering Department, Institut Teknologi Kalimantan. I received a Ph.D.
in Civil Engineering from Nagoya University, Japan. I am currently started
studying machine learning and really interested on utilizing
it for tsunami early warning systems. It is expected that this approach will be
able to forecast tsunami waveform and inundation in a real-time manner.

In my free time, I enjoy culinary hunting, reading history/archaeology books,
and riding a bicycle.
