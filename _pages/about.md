Hi, thank you for visiting my homepage. I am Ardiansyah Fauzi, a Ph.D. student in Civil Engineering at Nagoya University, Japan. I am currently really interested on utilizing artificial intelligence approaches for tsunami early warning system. This includes tsunami waveform and inundation forecasting.
